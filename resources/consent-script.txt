Confidentiality and Consent Script

60-SECOND OVERVIEW
Read this script before any circle, recording, or story gathering session.

SCRIPT
Welcome. Today we gather stories about identity, faith, caste, and gender.
Share only what you are ready to share. Passing is always welcome.
Tell us if we can quote you, record you, or keep your story private.
You can change your mind later. Email hello@equalvoicescollective.org and we will remove your story within 24 hours.
We will log your consent choices and confirm updates so you can trust the process.

FACILITATOR CUE
Pause after the script to answer questions and note any withdrawal requests immediately.
