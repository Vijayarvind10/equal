Ten Minute Warmups for Large Lectures

60-SECOND OVERVIEW
Five quick routines that settle the room, gather voices, and prime students for sensitive topics.

WARMUPS
1. Breath and notice: two breaths, then one word describing how you arrive.
2. Postcard: respond to an image prompt using three nouns and one verb.
3. Pair share: ninety seconds each on a guiding question, then trade takeaways.
4. Stand and sort: move to a corner labeled with a stance, share why, then rotate.
5. Exit ticket preview: name one curiosity and one care request before content begins.

TIPS
Display prompts on slides and read them aloud for accessibility.
Always remind students that passing is welcome.
