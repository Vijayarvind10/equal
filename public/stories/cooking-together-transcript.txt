Transcript (2 minutes):
Student A: We kept thinking about how cooking was always women's work in our houses. Making dal together felt like remembering the aunties who kept everyone running.
Student B: Yeah, and we set ground rules first. No one had to share family names. We just talked about how that labor travels with us.
Student A: The question about rest hit me. We never said resting was part of resistance until tonight.
Student B: Slowing down to cook was resistance. We wrote it down so we can read it out loud next class.
