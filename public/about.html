          <p class="lead">Equal Voices Collective exists to make learning about identity and power more humane, more practical, and easier to teach. We serve the instructors, students, and community members who want conversations that take care as seriously as content.</p>

          <p>I design and facilitate learning experiences where students can speak, think, and write with care. My work centers on reflection, respectful dialogue, and the small habits that make a classroom feel safe and alive. I focus on clear instructions, practical scaffolds, and warm, timely feedback.</p>
