          <h1>Neighbors helping neighbors, with structure</h1>
          <p class="lead">NeighborLift Network started as a rapid response toolkit for one apartment block. Now it helps coordinators in dozens of towns launch dependable volunteer circuits in days, not months.</p>

            <h3>Our mission</h3>
            <p>To make short-term care practical. We give local teams the tools to run errands, rides, and phone check-ins with dignity, consistency, and transparent safety practices.</p>

          <article class="surface">
            <h3>Community promise</h3>
            <p>Residents always choose how they are supported. Volunteers receive clear agreements, background checks, and escalation protocols before a single visit begins.</p>

        <details open>
          <summary>Start with a circuit plan</summary>
          <p>Every new team receives a six-week planner with staffing ratios, task checklists, and SMS reminders they can copy into any scheduling app.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>Build in safety</summary>
          <p>We require buddy shifts, coordinator escalation contacts, and consent logs for entry to every home. Incident forms and support numbers are standard.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>Track what matters</summary>
          <p>Volunteer daybooks feed into simple dashboards that show visits completed, upcoming requests, and unresolved concerns so leads can intervene early.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>Share what works</summary>
          <p>Successful circuit templates go back into the library so the next block can launch faster and avoid common pitfalls.</p>
